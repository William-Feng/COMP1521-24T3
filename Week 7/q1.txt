On a 16-bit system, we have 2^16 = 65,536 possible integers that we can represent.
Possible range for signed integers (int16_t) is: -2^15 ~ (2^15 - 1) = -32,768 ~ 32767.

(30000 + 30000) will overflow to the negative values.

We need to specify that we are dealing with unsigned integers.
Possible range for unsigned integers (uint16_t) is: 0 ~ (2^16 - 1) = 0 ~ 65,535.

Solution: (30000u + 30000u)
