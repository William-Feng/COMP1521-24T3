# COMP1521 24T3 Tutorial

Hey there!

This Git repository contains all the resources and code covered during the tutorial each week.

If you're unfamiliar with Git and wish to download the entire repository, you can click on the green 'Code' dropdown button and select 'Download ZIP'. Otherwise, you can run `git clone https://github.com/William-Feng/COMP1521-24T3.git` and pull the updates after each week.

Of course, you can also select the relevant week and file if you just wish to view the code.

Note that this repo doesn't have any detailed comments or responses to the theoretical questions, so please try to follow along when I do the walkthroughs and explain the most important problems.

If you have any questions, feel free to shoot me an email at [william.q.feng@student.unsw.edu.au](mailto:william.q.feng@student.unsw.edu.au).
